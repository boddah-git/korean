\subsection{Endings}

When conjugating a verb, we always take into account the dictionary form of a word, which will always end in \rom[]{다}{da}, this is what we call in English the \textit{citation form} or \textit{lemma}, maybe you could compare it with the "to" in words like "to go", "to eat", and so on. If we remove this 다, we get what we call the \textit{stem} of the verb.

\subsubsection{Grammatical Mood Endings}
The English language is quite reserved with these endings, you have present, past, past participle and continous, and in order to express these moods, we use an auxiliary verb at the start of the verb (I \textit{should} go, I \textit{was} going, I \textit{could} go, and so on). In Korean, there are different endings for each grammatical mood, and it could be quite tedious compared to English.

Depending on the grammatical mood \rom[form]{형}{hyeong} of the sentence, each level has a specific ending. The four most important grammatical moods and the ones explained in further detail are \textit{indicative, interrogative, imperative and propositive}.

In order to make this text as light as possible, the grammatical rules won't be explained with much detail\footnote{I would like to justify my lazyness by saying that there are over 40 basic endings and over 400 different combinations}, it is recommended to use sites or conjugating dictionaries that are built for that purpose, and trying to build knowledge by experience rather by memorizing some \textit{very} specific rules.

Here are some tables with these grammatical moods in action with its most simple rules:

\section{The Book's Structure}

This text has the intention of being read in any order, so there might be repeated information. However, in order to avoid redundancy, the text will assume you've read and understood this chapter and will not repeat any information explained in said chapter.

It is worth warning that this text will try to use the least amount of words possible. This is due to the fact that adding new unnecessary vocabulary may result overwhelming for the learning process of a specific section. 

Also, even though this text will only teach Korean, it was structured as a "blueprint" for any language I wanted to learn and with the purpose of learning and putting into practice linguistics. Therefore, you can use this text as a way of structuring your learning process while learning a new language.
